    "### 1. What is the difference between a spreadsheet and a database?\n",
    "Spreadsheet software allows for data entry and analyses, including organizing data into rows and columns, calculating simple solutions, and creating charts. A key limitation of spreadsheet software is that it does not have capacity for managing and analyzing large or complex data sets. Databse software addresses these limitations and can store large amounts of data, provide more data integrity control, and offer tools that allow users to explore complex data relationships. "
