    "The Havasupai tribe case involved the misuse of blood sample data from members of the Havasupai tribe by researchers at the Arizona State University (ASU). ASU researchers had informed consent to use health data to support an investigation on the genetic underpinnings of diabetes within the Havasupai community. However, without obtaining further informed consent, researchers used the same blood samples to conduct additional studies, such as investigating genetic markers for schizophrenia, metabolic disorders, and tracing geographical origins.The Havasupai Tribe sued ASU and the Arizona Board of Regents, receiving $700,000 in damages, return of blood samples, and other assistance."

    "The pulse oximeter controversy is an example of how bias can be very discrete in health data and technology, but can have negative implications that reinforce health disparities. The pulse oximeter is a common medical device used to measure blook oxygen levels in the blood. However, studies have shown that these devices are inherently racially biased due to utilizing algorithms to calculate oxygen saturation that are primarily based on data from light-skinned individuals. This is problematic because darker skin pigmintation can absorb mor elight and potentially lead to a pulse oximiter overestimating oxygen levels. Recent studies have shown that pulse oximeters were nearly three times more likely to miss hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels) among Black patients compared to White patients. "
